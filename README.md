# Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA

This repository contains a time series forecasting model built using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) method. The model is designed to predict future values based on historical time series data.

## Model Overview

The ARIMA model is a powerful tool for time series forecasting that combines three components:
- **AutoRegressive (AR)**: Uses the dependency between an observation and a number of lagged observations (i.e., previous values).
- **Integrated (I)**: Uses differencing of observations (subtracting an observation from an observation at the previous time step) to make the time series stationary.
- **Moving Average (MA)**: Uses the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.

The combination of these components is denoted as ARIMA(p, d, q), where:
- **p**: The number of lag observations included in the model (AR part).
- **d**: The number of times that the raw observations are differenced (I part).
- **q**: The size of the moving average window (MA part).

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps for handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
- **Model Training**: Training the ARIMA model with specified parameters.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Forecasting**: Generating future predictions based on the trained model.

## Usage

To use this model, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed. You can use the following command if you are using `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
    Open and run the Jupyter notebook (`arima-model.ipynb`) to see the model in action. The notebook contains all the steps from data loading to model training and forecasting.
   
## Results
The ARIMA model provides accurate forecasts for the given time series data, as demonstrated in the notebook. Below are some example plots and performance metrics:

## Conclusion
The ARIMA model is an effective method for time series forecasting, capable of capturing various patterns in the data. For more details and to run the model yourself, please refer to the included Jupyter notebook.

## Example

Here's a brief example of how to use the ARIMA model for forecasting:

```python
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv('your-time-series-data.csv')
series = data['your_column']

# Fit ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(series, order=(p, d, q))
model_fit = model.fit()

# Make a forecast
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=10)
print(forecast)
